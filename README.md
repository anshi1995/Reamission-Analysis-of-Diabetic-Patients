# Reamission-Analysis-of-Diabetic-Patients
Diabetes is a chronic disease and one of the leading factors of death in recent times. It is widespread among a vast population and majorly contributes to several other diseases. The term ‘Hospital Readmission’ refers to when a patient discharged from a hospital has to be re-admitted within a certain time interval. The patients hospitalized with diabetes have a higher risk of being readmitted than the ones who weren’t hospitalized. The rate of hospital readmission is an indicator of the hospital quality as well as the treatment being performed.

With this project, we aim to identify the likelihood of hospital readmission of a diabetic patient. Using the diverse features containing heterogeneous medical data about patients, we will explore various Machine Learning models to predict whether the diabetic patient is readmitted or not. This analysis will facilitate the hospitals in identifying the factors that lead to higher readmission of patients and thereby, improving the quality of their care or changing medications being offered.
